# Yale NUS Hack4Climate (https://hack4climate.live/)
## Winner of Datathon Track

In this Hackathon, we created visualizations to attribute responsibility to different actors: Sectors, Countries and Cities. 
1. Under Sectors, we created stacked bar charts to compare the countries' current greenhouse gas contributing sectors and compare them to the sectors that they commited to reduce under Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC). The main purpose is to see the gap between their current contribution and their commitment to understand the extent of genuine climate action by the country. 
2. Under Countries, we look at the impact magnitude of contribution of several countries to send across a message that the commitments should be proportional to the greenhouse gas contribution. 
3. Under Cities, we are also looking at what are possible cities that are similar to one another and therefore can learn from each other. Using SpaCy to mine keywords associated to each cities, we used the keywords as well as the demographics of the cities to compare and pick put similar cities. We hope that by choosing cities that are of similar condition and focus, they could learn from each other's solution and implementation to tackle climate problems
